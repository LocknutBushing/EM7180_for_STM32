This repository provides C code for using the EM7180 sensor hub with STM32 boards, and is adapted from [Kris Winer's](https://github.com/kriswiner) [EM7180_SENtral_sensor_hub](https://github.com/kriswiner/EM7180_SENtral_sensor_hub) library (which was written in C++ for Arduino).

This library has been tested with the [STM32 NUCLEO-F411RE](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F411RE/) and the [EM7180 Ultimate Sensor Fusion Solution](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/ultimate-sensor-fusion-solution-mpu9250/) with MPU9250 gyro/accelerometer and the BMP280 barometric pressure sensor. It can be further modified to work with the rest of the EM7180 Ultimate Sensor Fusion Solution boards.
